EFL

EFL is made up of quite a few libraries that build on top of each other in layers, steadily becoming higher-level, yet allowing access to each level as they go. The higher up you go, the less you have to do yourself. Elementary is about as high up as you get, while you still access layers below it for day to day things as there is no need for it to wrap things that work perfectly well as-is.
